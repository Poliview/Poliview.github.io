This course provides an introduction to issues of theory, approach, and
evidence in the field of comparative-historical analysis. Although
methodological topics will inevitably come up, the course is not primarily a
class on comparative-historical methods.

  

The overall objective is to help students understand, appreciate, and critique
excellent works of comparative-historical analysis. These skills in turn
should help students who want to pursue research in this field to create their
own excellent works of comparative-historical analysis.

  

The course workload falls into three categories: readings, weekly assignments,
and seminar participation. The readings include both substantive studies
(mostly books) and writings that discuss issues related to approach, theory
application, and evidence (mostly articles). The overall organization of the
syllabus is roughly to alternate between substantive studies and readings on
method, approach, and theory.

  

Each week students will be asked to turn in a short assignment. The
assignments will generally require students to analyze a substantive reading
in light of a key methodological issue or problem; they are intended to
encourage students to think about the substantive readings in light of the
issues raised in the explicitly analytical readings. These assignments will
involve short essays and/or other exercises (e.g., creating charts and
graphs). Because students may be especially busy during certain parts of the
quarter, they need only complete 6 of the 9 short assignments during the
semester.

  

Seminar participation and discussion are crucial to the success of this
course. I ask students to come to class each week prepared to discuss at least
one key issue from the readings. I also expect students to be prepared to
react to and discuss the issues raised by others. I will try to provide a
comfortable setting that encourages exploration, exchange, and student
fellowship.
