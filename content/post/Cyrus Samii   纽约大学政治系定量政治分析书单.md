 **Texts**

  

The course will draw a lot from the following two textbooks:

  

  1. Angrist, Joshua, and Steffan Jorg Pischke. 2009. Mostly Harmless Econometrics. Princeton: Princeton University Press. (Referred to as MHE.)

  

  2. Morgan, Stephen L., and Christopher Winship. 2014. Counterfactuals and Causal Inference: Methods and Principles for Social Research, Second Edition. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. (Referred to as CCI.)

  

The course will mostly follow MHE, using CCI to provide more intuitive
background and illustrations. I will also supplement the textbooks with notes,
sections from other textbooks, and journal articles. I have listed “further
reading” for each topic, and my lectures will sometimes draw on these.

  

The books are each detailed, up to date, and they complement each other well.
The books are relatively inexpensive, so students are recommended to acquire
both. MHE can be mathematically difficult at times, but you are strongly
encouraged to dive in, replicate proofs, and work hard to understand it. CCI
provides intuition to keep you sane and grounded.

  

While these two textbooks are technically sound, they do gloss over details on
estimation mechanics. An excellent textbook that provides the proper
statistical background for this course is the following:

  

  * Hansen, Bruce E. 2017. Econometrics. Typescript, University of Wisconsin.

  

It is freely available on Hansen’s website, and there is also a PDF in our
readings dropbox.

  

For those of you that feel like you need to refresh/improve your mathematical
chops, the following is a nice workbook style development of rudiments for
regression and statistical inference, with a critical eye:

  

  * Freedman, David A. 2009. Statistical Models: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

  

My dear favorite graduate-level intro textbook, and the one that I used in ye
olden days, is the following:

  

  * Goldberger, Arthur S. 1991. A Course in Econometrics. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.

  

Goldberger develops the theory of “agnostic” linear regression step-by-step
from first principles. It’s a classic, but out of print (you can get cheap
used versions on Amazon though). An updated take is given in the following:

  

  * Aronow, Peter M., and Benjamin Miller. 2015. Theory of Agnostic Statistics. Typescript, Yale University.

  

You can get it here: http://aronow.research.yale.edu/aronowmiller.pdf

  

The following textbooks provide some deeper theoretical insights on statistics
for causal inference and I will sometimes reference them:

  

  * Imbens, Guido W., and Donald B. Rubin. 2015. Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

  

  * Pearl, Judea. 2009. Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference, Second Edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

  

 **Topics**

  

Topics listed below will be covered in around 1-2 class sessions each.
Required reading sometimes corresponds directly to material covered in the
sessions and sometimes builds up background needed for future sessions. Most
of the required reading comes from MHE and CCI, although the topics covered
toward the end of the semester will draw on other texts that will be made
available.

  

 **1 Identification, estimation, and inference**

  

 _Identification concepts:_ randomization and the experimental ideal,
manipulability, potential outcome model of causal effects, average treatment
effects, dose-response functions. Estimation concepts: estimands and

process, implications of randomization and sampling, stochasticity, choosing
an “error term,” exact distributions, asymptotic distributions and central
limit theorem.
